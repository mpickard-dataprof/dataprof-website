    "title": "regex to Preserve Currency Tokens",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nI’ve been working to collect a corpus of tax legislation, regulations, and court cases. At the core of my corpus is the United States Code Title 26 (USC26), otherwise known as the Internal Revenue Code or the U.S. Tax Code. I’m using the corpus to train a tax-specific word embedding. Word embeddings capture similarity semantics of tokens (words, or multi-word phrases) by encoding them into an n-dimensional space. Similar tokens are embedded into the n-dimensional space in close proximity.\nSince currency values may have important semantic meaning in the USC–for instance, tax bracket boundaries–I want to preserve them so the tokenizer does not break them apart. To do this, I want to replace spaces, commas, decimals, and dollar signs with underscores. Here are some examples:\n\nExamples of Currency Values\n\n\nOriginal\nPreserved\n\n\n\n\n$172,175\n172_175_usd\n\n\n$2.5 million\n2_5_million_usd\n\n\n$56,750.25\n56_750_25_usd\n\n\n\n\n\nImplementation\nThe approach I took was to first match the different currency formats and then pass the match to a helper function that would replace spaces, commas, decimals, and dollar signs with underscores.\nHere is the pattern I created to match currency tokens:\n\npattern = r'\\$\\d{0,3}(\\,\\d{3}){0,4}(\\.\\d{1,2})?( (million|billion))?'\n\n\n\\$ matches a dollar sign.\n\\d{0,3} The number after the dollar sign and before a comma or decimal boundary. Looking for 0 to 3 digits allows for these patterns: $.75, $125,000, etc.\n(\\,\\d{3}){0,4}(\\.\\d{1,2})? matches repeated comma boundaries (if they exist) and two-decimal places for cents (if they exist). More specifically:\n\n(\\,\\d{3}) matches “,xxx”. With the addition of {0,4} it matches “,xxx” repeatedly–up to trillions (which is probably overkill for the USC26 because most large currency values have “million” or “billion” text suffixes).\n(\\.\\d{1,2})? matches an optional cents.\n\n( (million|billion))? just checks for a text suffix (the ? at the end makes it optional.)\n\nNext, here is a simple helper function to replace spaces, commas, decimals, and dollar signs with underscores and tack on “_usd” at the end. Python’s string replace() method is faster than the regex sub(), so I went with replace().\n\nimport re\n\ndef replace_currency_parts(match):\n    text = match.group(0).replace(\" \", \"_\").replace(\".\", \"_\").replace(',', '_')\n    if (text[0] == '$'):\n        text = text[1:] + \"_usd\"\n    return text\n\nNow I need a test string.\n\ntest_string = \"I made $755.34 billion this year, $5.34 million last year, but I also want to match $125,234.34 and $1,342.40 and $45.09 and $45 in case that's a more realistic salary in my life.\"\n\nThen I compile the regex and replace matches. Notice that the second argument of sub() can take a method that returns a string. I leverage this to call the helper function.\n\ncompiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern)\ncompiled_pattern.sub(replace_currency_parts, test_string)\n\n\"I made 755_34_billion_usd this year, 5_34_million_usd last year, but I also want to match 125_234_34_usd and 1_342_40_usd and 45_09_usd and 45_usd in case that's a more realistic salary in my life.\"\n\n\nHere is the full Python implementation.\n\nimport time\nimport timeit\n\npattern = r'\\$\\d{0,3}(\\,\\d{3}){0,4}(\\.\\d{1,2})?( (million|billion))?'\n\ndef replace_currency_parts(match):\n    text = match.group(0).replace(\" \", \"_\").replace(\".\", \"_\").replace(',', '_')\n    if (text[0] == '$'):\n        text = text[1:] + \"_usd\"\n    return text\n\ntest_string = \"I made $355.34 million this year, $435.34 billion last year, but I also want to match $125,234.34 and $1,342.40 and $45.09 and $45.\"\n\ncompiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern)\ncompiled_pattern.sub(replace_currency_parts, test_string)\n\n\n\nR Implementation\nI was curious if python was that much faster than R. So, here is an R implementation. Like Python’s sub(), the str_replace_all function can take a helper function.\n\nlibrary(stringr)\n\npattern <- '\\\\$\\\\d{0,3}(\\\\,\\\\d{3}){0,4}(\\\\.\\\\d{1,2})?( (million|billion))?'\n\nreplace_currency_parts <- function(match) {\n  \n  text <- match %>% \n    str_replace_all(\" \", \"_\") %>% \n    str_replace_all(\"\\\\.\", \"_\") %>% \n    str_replace_all(\"\\\\,\", \"_\")\n    \n  if (str_sub(text, 1, 1) == \"$\"){\n    text <- str_c(str_sub(text, 2), \"_usd\")\n  }\n    \n  return(text)\n}\n\ntest_string <-  \"I made $355.34 million this year, $435.34 billion last year, but I also want to match $125,234.34 and $1,342.40 and $45.09 and $45.\"\n\nstr_replace_all(test_string, pattern, replace_currency_parts)\n\n[1] \"I made 355_34_million_usd this year, 435_34_billion_usd last year, but I also want to match 125_234_34_usd and 1_342_40_usd and 45_09_usd and 45_usd.\"\n\n\n\n\nWhich is faster?\nSo, which is faster?\nI compare the Python and R implementations by taking the average of 1000 executions of the code. Since the {stringr} package in R is higher level–there’s no option to compile the regex ahead of time and keep it out of the loop–I placed the Python regex compile code inside the loop to make a more fair comparison. In both cases, the units are milliseconds. NOTE: The python time() method returns seconds, so I convert.\n\nfrom time import time\n\nstart_ms = int(round(time() * 1000))\nfor i in range(1000):\n  compiled_pattern = re.compile(pattern)\n  str = compiled_pattern.sub(replace_currency_parts, test_string)\nend_ms = int(round(time() * 1000))\n\nprint(\"elapsed ms = \", (end_ms-start_ms)/1000)\n\nelapsed ms =  0.03\n\n\n\nlibrary(microbenchmark)\n\nmicrobenchmark::microbenchmark(str_replace_all(test_string, pattern, replace_currency_parts), times = 1000)\n\nUnit: milliseconds\n                                                          expr    min      lq\n str_replace_all(test_string, pattern, replace_currency_parts) 3.9244 4.33575\n     mean  median     uq    max neval\n 4.716089 4.52625 4.8115 9.4067  1000\n\n\nI don’t know what overhead is included in the {stringr} package, but it’s about two orders of magnitude slower than Python. I suspect it is because the Python replace() string method is quite speedy."

We’ll cover both a manual approach with dplyr functions and a more automated, production approach with recipes functions. Enjoy!\n\n\nVariance is important in feature selection because of a concept called information gain. Information gain is what we know about one (usually unknown) variable because we can observe another known variable. In supervised learning, we use information from predictor variables to learn something about the target variable.\nTo make this concrete, imagine we want to estimate loan applicants’ creditworthiness. Though we don’t have their credit scores, we do have their monthly income, age, and number of outstanding loans. If every applicant in our data set has three outstanding loans – that is, the number of outstanding loans didn’t vary – then “outstanding loans” does not differentiate loan applicants and, therefore, does not provide any information about the applicants that we can use to estimate their creditworthiness. Therefore, we’d say that number of outstanding loans provides no information gain about creditworthiness.\nWe can remove features with little to no variance because they are not informative. Consider them useless fluff."

So, we are going to separate the continuous and the categorical variables into separate DataFrames.\nFor the continuous variables, we’ll impute the median.\n\nfrom sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper\nfrom sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer\n\n# extract numeric columns\nnumeric_mask = (X.dtypes != object)\nnumeric_columns = X.columns[numeric_mask].tolist()\nnumeric_df = X[numeric_columns]\n\n# create \"imputer\", just going to fill missing values with \"missing\"\nnumeric_imputor = DataFrameMapper(\n  [([numeric_feature], SimpleImputer(strategy='median')) for numeric_feature in numeric_df],\n  input_df=True,\n  df_out=True\n  )\n\nFor the categorical variables, we’ll impute the value ‘missing’.\n\n# extract categorical features\ncategorical_mask = (X.dtypes == object)\ncategorical_columns = X.columns[categorical_mask].tolist()\ncategorical_df = X[categorical_columns]\n\ncategorical_imputor = DataFrameMapper(\n  [([categorical_feature], SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value = \"missing\")) for categorical_feature in categorical_df],\n  input_df=True,\n  df_out=True\n  )\n\n\n\nBuild the pipeline\nWe are going to use sklearn’s DictVectorizer, which operates on numpy arrays/matrices. So to make it compatible with DataFrames, we’ll create a simple utility class to allow a DataFrame to be passed through the pipeline. Thanks to Chanseok for the dictifier code.\n\nfrom sklearn.base import BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin\n\n# Define Dictifier class to turn df into a dictionary as part of the pipeline\nclass Dictifier(BaseEstimator, TransformerMixin):\n  def fit(self, X, y=None):\n    return self\n  \n  def transform(self, X):\n    if type(X) == pd.core.frame.DataFrame:\n      return X.to_dict(\"records\")\n    else:\n      return pd.DataFrame(X).to_dict(\"records\")\n\nNow we build the pipeline. Notice how we use the FeatureUnion to bring the continuous and categorical features back together again at the start of the pipeline.\n\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import FeatureUnion\nfrom sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline\nfrom sklearn.feature_extraction import DictVectorizer\nimport xgboost as xgb\n\nimputed_df = FeatureUnion([\n  ('num_imputer', numeric_imputor),\n  ('cat_imputer', categorical_imputor)    \n  ])\n  \nxgb_pipeline = Pipeline([\n  (\"featureunion\", imputed_df),\n  ('dictifier', Dictifier()),\n  ('dict_vectorizer', DictVectorizer(sort=False)),\n  (\"xgb\", xgb.XGBClassifier(use_label_encoder=False, eval_metric='logloss'))\n  ])\n\n\n\n3-Fold Cross Validation\nWe’ll use 3-fold cross-validation (instead of 10, or something greater) to minimize compute time.\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n\nscores = cross_val_score(xgb_pipeline, X, y, scoring=\"f1\", cv=3)\navg_f1 = np.mean(np.sqrt(np.abs(scores)))\nprint(\"Avg F1 Score:\", avg_f1)\n\nAvg F1 Score: 0.9999863537583441\n\n\n\n\nConclusions\nThe average F1 score is suspiciously high, so let’s not put much clout on the quality of the model. But it serves the purpose of demonstrating how to pass a ‘pandas’ DataFrame through a sklearn pipeline, preprocess mixed variable (continuous and categorical) data, and build an xgboost classifier.\nJust because it’s bugging me, here are a few things that may need to be improved in this model:\n\nThere is probably a high correlation between the target variable and some feature variables. We can check this quickly. Fill the NAs with zero and correlate it with the loan status (which is 0 and 1).\n\n\nnumeric_fillna_df = numeric_df.fillna(0)\nnumeric_fillna_df.corrwith(y)\n\nyear                         NaN\nloan_amount            -0.036825\nrate_of_interest       -0.958875\nInterest_rate_spread   -0.392977\nUpfront_charges        -0.431183\nterm                   -0.000675\nproperty_value         -0.273267\nincome                 -0.044620\nCredit_Score            0.004004\nLTV                    -0.267700\ndtir1                  -0.325613\ndtype: float64\n\n\nWe can see that rate_of_interest has a high inverse correlation with the target variable. However, I did try removing rate_of_interest and still ended up with an F1 score of 0.9999.\n\nFind a better way to impute the missing categorical. Chirag Goyal enumerates some options in this post. I suspect that building a model to predict missing values would be an option. Another simpler option would be to just randomly insert existing values. But, currently, with the imputer in this post, it is essentially treating ‘missing’ as a legit value."

    "section": "The topic model",
    "text": "The topic model\nLike clustering algorithms, LDA requires that we specify the number of topics to fit. With close to 4k talks and 16k+ words, it wasn’t clear to me how many topics I should fit. To discover this, I leveraged the divergence metric of the topic model. seededlda, in its divergence() function, implements the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence, which is frequently used to measure the dissimilarities between word distributions (i.e., topics) 2.\nIn a nutshell, the logic of topic divergence is like this:\n\nTopics consist of individual words. For example,\n\nFamily: children, family, home, parents, love, god, husband, wife\nMissionary Work: mission, missionary, serve, gospel, elder, lord\nSavior: love, christ, jesus, savior, father, heart\n\nThe words that make up topics can overlap, meaning that the words can appear in several topics. For instance, love appears in both the Savior and Family topics.\nWhen we minimize the overlap, or maximize the divergence, of topics; then we have some assurance that we have the most distinct and useful topics.\n\nTo find the optimal number of topics, I fit topic models with 2 to 52 topics.\n\nNote: There was a bit of trial and error to arrive at that range.\n\nThen I plotted their divergence scores to see where they maxed out.\nSince fitting LDA models is computationally expensive, I used the furrr package – the parallelized version of purrr – on my high-powered server to fit all those models.\nThen I combined the divergence score with each topic model into a data frame, so I could plot them.\n\nlibrary(seededlda)\nlibrary(furrr)\n\n# create a vector for number of topics to fit\nn <- seq(2, 52, by = 2)\n\n# helper function that fits the LDA model and computes the divergence\n# this is to parallelize the code with the 'furrr' package\nget_div_score <- function(dfm, k) {\n  lda_fit <- textmodel_lda(dfm, k)\n  return(divergence(lda_fit))\n}\n\n# setup four threads\nplan(multisession, workers = 4)\n\n# fit models in parallel\ndiv_scores <- n %>% \n  future_map_dbl(\n    ~get_div_score(unigram_dfm, k = .x),\n    furrr_options(seed = TRUE))\n\n# assemble a df with number of topics and divergence scores\ndiv_score_df <- tibble(\n  num_topics = n,\n  div_score = div_scores\n)\n\n\n\n\n\nFinding the maximum divergence – the quantitative part\nHere’s the code to create the number of topics vs. divergence plot.\n\n# plot topic number vs divergence score\ndiv_score_df %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = num_topics, y = div_score)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  ylab(\"Divergence Score\") +\n  xlab(\"Number of Topics\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept = max(div_score_df$div_score), \n             color = \"blue\", \n             linetype = \"dashed\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", \n           x=30, \n           y=max(div_score_df$div_score)+0.01, \n           label=\"0.436\",\n           color = \"blue\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Number of Topics vs Divergence\")\n\n\n\n\nIn the end, it was easier to just view the top three results in a table.\n\ndiv_score_df %>% \n  arrange(desc(div_score)) %>% \n  head(5)\n\n# A tibble: 5 × 2\n  num_topics div_score\n       <dbl>     <dbl>\n1         30     0.436\n2         32     0.435\n3         28     0.434\n4         24     0.433\n5         26     0.433\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting the topics – the qualitative part\nWhile the 30-topic model has the highest divergence, maximal divergence does not necessarily mean that that number of topics is maximally meaningful. So I took the models with the top three divergence scores (32-topic, 30-topic, and 28-topics) and explored the quality of the topics.\nI created these models in parallel on my server. Here’s the code:\n\nn <- c(28, 30, 32)\n\nplan(multisession, workers = 3)\nlda_fits <- n %>% \n  future_map(\n    ~textmodel_lda(unigram_dfm, k = .x),\n    furrr_options(seed = TRUE))\n\nAfter the 28-, 30-, and 32-topics models were fit, I created labels for each topic based on the words that the topic was composed of to evaluate the topic quality. Here I’ll demonstrate this process with the 30- and 32-topic models.\nI extracted the words per topic with the terms() function and formed them into a tibble for ease of reading. Then I proceeded to subjectively interpret the topics based on the top 10 words in each topic. I don’t believe there is a way to avoid this. Notice that I updated the column names with meaningful labels.\nIt is expected that there will be some noisy topics. If the topic wasn’t clear to me, I labeled it with question marks.\n\n\n\n\nlibrary(knitr) \n\nlda30_df <- as_tibble(terms(lda_fits[[2]]))\n\nnames(lda30_df) <- \n  c(\"01_Lost_Sheep\",\n

30-topic vs 32-topic\nTo wrap my mind around the pros and cons of the two models. I captured some of the differences in this table.\n\nThis is where contextual knowledge of the data is needed.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n30-Topic Model\n32-Topic Model\n\n\n\n\nBook of Mormon gets paired with scriptures and scripture reading. Joseph Smith has his own topic.\nBook of Mormon gets paired with joseph smith\n\n\nPrayer has its own topic.\nprayer gets placed inside the The Holy Ghost and Testimony topic.\n\n\nJesus Christ is paired with savior\nJesus Christ is paired with resurrection.\n\n\nSeems to have a Lost Sheep topic.\nThere is not topic that contains sheep.\n\n\nsacrament is paired with sabbath day (topic #21)\nsacrament is paired with covenants.\n\n\ntithing is found under the Church Welfare topic.\ntithing is paired with sacrifice and pay, which seems to solidly form a Tithing topic\n\n\n\nI like the fact that Joseph Smith has his own topic in the 30-topic model; and, it probably makes more sense to bundle the Book of Mormon with scriptures (since it is part of the scriptural canon of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints) than it does with Joseph Smith (who translated it). A strong nudge to favor the 30-topic model.\nPrayer and Christ’s direction to find and feed His “lost sheep” are both very common topics in GC talks. The 30-topic has separate topics for each of these. That’s a couple of votes for the 30-topic model.\nI especially like that the Jesus Christ topic contains savior. I prefer that associate as Savior over the associate with resurrection in the 32-topic model. I view His resurrection as part of His saving.\nMembers of the Church meet together on Sundays (the Sabbath day) to partake of the Sacrament (i.e., the Lord’s Supper), so it’s very appropriate to associate the Sacrament with the Sabbath day. However, the Sacrament is a time for church members to remember the covenants they made at baptism; so it’s equally appropriate to associate the Sacrament with covenants as well. So, this point is a wash.\nTithing as its own topic (in the 32-topic model) is appealing. A win for the 32-topic model. However, tithing is often spoken of in the context of fast offerings. Fast offerings are free-will monetary offerings given in conjunction with a fast – the money saved from skipping meals during the fast is donated to help the poor and needy. A counter for the 30-topic model. But the 32-topic option highlights tithing in terms of sacrifice. You might consider tithing as a baseline measure of an individual’s willingness to sacrifice for the Lord. A stronger counter for the 32-topic model.\nSo, overall, we’ll go with the 30-topic model.\n\nAs I explored models with more topics, I discovered that other topics crystalized, examples include youth and the latter days, home teaching (a program to ensure members of the church are taken care of and watched over), pioneers and trek to Salt Lake City, and revelation.\n\nLet’s pull out the 30-topic model.\n\nlda30_fit <- lda_fits[[2]]"
