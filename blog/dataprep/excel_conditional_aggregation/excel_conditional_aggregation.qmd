## Introduction

Data aggregation is the process of combining multiple data points into a single number. It's synonymous with summarization. In this post, we'll review how to use aggregation functions in Excel -- specifically, the conditional aggregation functions (e.g., `COUNTIFS()`, `SUMIFS()`, and `AVERAGEIFS()`).

## Example of COUNTIFS()
The COUNT function family is the simplest. We'll demonstrate an example here.

Notice the formula in G1, takes pairs of arguments -- *criteria_range* and *criteria*. Here we count only rows that meet two conditions:

1) Product = "Pants" -- B2:B10 is the *criteria_range1*, in other words, that's the range of cells we are going to check to see if they are equal to "Pants" (which is the *criteria*).
2) Color = "Tan" -- C2:C10 is the range of color values to check (*criteria_range2*) and "Tan" is the *criteria*. 

So we only include products where the Color is "Tan" (and the Product is "Pants") in the count.
